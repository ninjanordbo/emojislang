EMOJI SLANG

Emojis are a great way to lighten up messages, express empathy and show how you're feeling. It's a universally understood language that crosses lingual borders which can make communication much more successful. But, did you know there are emojis out there with hidden meanings? Some of the most popular emojis actually come with some dark and disturbing stories behind them.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, EJS, MongoDB.

Building the app in Node and Express was a good choice for this app, since it was a quite small project which did not need too much. 

## Optimizations

I would have loved to add upvoting to the this site, but time was too short. 

## Lessons Learned:

Learned how to problemshoot Heroku setup with this project. After lots of back and forth I finally managed to figure out where I had gone wrong. Turned out that
my environment variables were not properly configured and also had to update my config vars inside Heroku.
